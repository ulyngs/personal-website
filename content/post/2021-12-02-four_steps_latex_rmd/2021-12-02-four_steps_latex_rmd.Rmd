```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center')

# don't number figures with a caption
knitr::opts_knit$set(bookdown.internal.label = FALSE)

image_path <- "/post/2021-12-02-four_steps_latex_rmd/"

# stop knitr from throwing an error when image path doesn't (yet) exist
options(knitr.graphics.error = FALSE)

```

I do all my academic writing in [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ "R Markdown: The Definitive Guide"). 
This makes my work more transparent and reproducible for others and my future self.

Along the way, I have often needed to use a specific LaTeX template from some [conference](https://ulriklyngs.com/post/2018/10/29/r-packages-for-chi-papers-with-r-markdown/) to format my PDF output from R Markdown.
Over time, I've learned that there are 4 steps involved in doing this.

In this post, I go over these four steps, and illustrate them with the [PLOS LaTeX template](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex).

# Step 1: Make the template compile on its own (aka, watch your \$)

The first step is to do the simplest thing you can.
Download the LaTeX template files from your journal/conference.
Then create a new R Markdown document and simply tell it to use the **.tex** file for PDF output, and try to knit it.

For example, if you go and download the [PLOS LaTeX template](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex), we get a folder that includes the file **plos_latex_template.tex**.
Then create a new R Markdown file with this content:

``` markdown
---
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
---

# Hello, LaTeX template!

This is a test.
```

Try knitting to PDF!
Argh, we get an error message:

``` markdown
Error compiling template "plos_latex_template.tex" (line 57, column 121):
unexpected "2"
expecting "$"
Error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 5
Execution halted
```

What's going on?
It turns out that dollar signs (\$) have special meaning for [pandoc](https://pandoc.org), the program that's responsible for some of the journey from R Markdown to PDF.
When pandoc sees a dollar sign in your template, it thinks you want to plug in stuff from your R Markdown file.

How do we solve this?
Just throw more money at the problem! That is, **for pandoc, a dollar sign in your template is escaped with another dollar sign.** So let's try and replace all single \$ with \$\$ in **plos_latex_template.tex.**

If you now knit to PDF, you get the expected output:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(str_c(image_path, "compile_correct.png"))
```

Awesome!
Our R Markdown file compiled using PLOS' **.tex** file as a template!

# Step 2: Pull in desired content from the R Markdown file
The only content we see in the PDF is the sample content from PLOS' **.tex** template.
How do we insert content from our R Markdown file?
**Use dollar signs:**

When pandoc sees something in the **.tex** file surrounded by single dollar signs, it'll look for something that corresponds to it in the R Markdown file.
Ask yourself this: What and where do you want to plug in stuff from the YAML header (i.e., the stuff in between `---` at the top)? And where do we want to plug in your body content?

## Pulling in stuff from the YAML header

We can start by simply adding a title to our R Markdown file:

``` markdown
---
title: "R Markdown + LaTeX Templates = <3"
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
---

# Hello, LaTeX template!

This is a test.
```

Then open up **plos_latex_template.tex** and look for the title.
It's here:

``` latex
% Title must be 250 characters or less.
\begin{flushleft}
{\Large
\textbf\newline{Title of submission to PLOS journals} % Please use "sentence case" for title and headings (capitalize only the first word in a title (or heading), the first word in a subtitle (or subheading), and any proper nouns).
}
\newline
```

Change it to this:

``` latex
% Title must be 250 characters or less.
\begin{flushleft}
{\Large
\textbf\newline{$title$} % Please use "sentence case" for title and headings (capitalize only the first word in a title (or heading), the first word in a subtitle (or subheading), and any proper nouns).
}
\newline
```

Now, if you knit you get this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(str_c(image_path, "pull-title.png"))
```

The variable names in your yaml header can be completely arbitrary --- yhey don't have to match something that pandoc has seen before.
So let's pull in also the abstract and the author summary, from the R Markdown file, but use silly names to illustrate:

``` markdown
---
title: "R Markdown + LaTeX Templates = <3"
silly-abstract: "This is the greatest and best abstract in the world."
silly-author-summary: "The important thing to know about this paper is that it is was written in close collaboration with Tenacious D, without whom our academic universe would have seized to be."
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
---

# Hello, LaTeX template!

This is a test.
```

Then find the abstract and author summary sections in **plos_latex_template.tex** and replace the sample content with our silly variables:

``` latex
% Please keep the abstract below 300 words
\section*{Abstract}
$silly-abstract$

% Please keep the Author Summary between 150 and 200 words
% Use first person. PLOS ONE authors please skip this step. 
% Author Summary not valid for PLOS ONE submissions.   
\section*{Author summary}
$silly-author-summary$
```

When you knit you get the expected output:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(str_c(image_path, "pull-yaml-silly.png"))
```


## Pulling in the body content

The body content is pulled in with a special variable: when you write `$body$` in the template, pandoc will insert your body content.

In the case of the PLOS template, replace everything from the introduction to end of the document with simply `$body$`. So


``` latex
% Use "Eq" instead of "Equation" for equation citations.
\section*{Introduction}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit~\cite{bib1} amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur eget porta erat. Morbi consectetur est vel gravida pretium. Suspendisse ut dui eu ante cursus gravida non sed...
```

becomes just

``` latex
$body$
```

When you knit you get:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(str_c(image_path, "pull-body.png"))
```


# Step 3: Enable code inclusion

You'll notice that if you add a code chunk in our R Markdown file, with the chunk option `echo=TRUE`, you get an error:

```` markdown
---
title: "R Markdown + LaTeX Templates = <3"
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
---

# Hello, LaTeX template!

This is a test.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 + 2
```
````

Here's the error:

``` markdown
! LaTeX Error: Environment Shaded undefined.

Error: LaTeX failed to compile using-latex-templates.tex. See https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging for debugging tips. See using-latex-templates.log for more info.
Execution halted
```

As the error message suggests, this is because code chunks are included in LaTeX file in a 'Shaded' environment. 
In our example, it looks like this:

``` latex
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
```

The problem is that our template **.tex** file doesn't define this environment.
Fix it by adding these three lines to the LaTeX template, before the `\begin{document}` command:

``` latex
$if(highlighting-macros)$
$highlighting-macros$
$endif$
```

What this will do is that *if* our R Markdown document includes code chunks with `echo=TRUE`, so that the code is displayed, *then* the necessary LaTeX packages and environments will automatically be added to the template.

If you knit again, you see the expected output:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(str_c(image_path, "enable-code.png"))
```


# Step 4: Decide how to include citations

Finally, you need to think about how you want to include citations.
There's (at least) three options:

1.  Use CSL ([Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org)) references
2.  Use the `natbib` LaTeX package
3.  Use the `biblatex` LaTeX package

Let's look at each.

## CSL references

The [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org) is an open-source project supported by Zotero, Mendeley, RefWorks, and others, and is the approach `pandoc` uses by default.
To enable it, you need to include the following in your LaTeX template:

``` latex
$if(csl-refs)$
\newlength{\cslhangindent}
\setlength{\cslhangindent}{1.5em}
\newlength{\csllabelwidth}
\setlength{\csllabelwidth}{3em}
\newlength{\cslentryspacingunit} % times entry-spacing
\setlength{\cslentryspacingunit}{\parskip}
\newenvironment{CSLReferences}[2] % #1 hanging-ident, #2 entry spacing
 {% don't indent paragraphs
  \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
  % turn on hanging indent if param 1 is 1
  \ifodd #1
  \let\oldpar\par
  \def\par{\hangindent=\cslhangindent\oldpar}
  \fi
  % set entry spacing
  \setlength{\parskip}{#2\cslentryspacingunit}
 }%
 {}
\usepackage{calc}
\newcommand{\CSLBlock}[1]{#1\hfill\break}
\newcommand{\CSLLeftMargin}[1]{\parbox[t]{\csllabelwidth}{#1}}
\newcommand{\CSLRightInline}[1]{\parbox[t]{\linewidth - \csllabelwidth}{#1}\break}
\newcommand{\CSLIndent}[1]{\hspace{\cslhangindent}#1}
$endif$
```

(These commands come from the default [`pandoc` LaTeX template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/data/templates/default.latex) and is how `pandoc` usually tells LaTeX how to include references).

For illustration purposes, create a new file that called **references.bib** and save it with this content:

``` bibtex
@InProceedings{lyngs2019,
  title = {Self-{{Control}} in {{Cyberspace}}: Applying {{Dual Systems Theory}} to a {{Review}} of {{Digital Self}}-{{Control Tools}}},
  booktitle = {{{CHIConference}} on {{Human Factors}} in {{Computing Systems Proceedings}} ({{CHI}} 2019)},
  author = {Ulrik Lyngs and Kai Lukoff and Petr Slovak and Reuben Binns and Adam Slack and Michael Inzlicht and Max {Van Kleek} and Nigel Shadbolt},
  date = {2019},
  publisher = {{ACM}},
  location = {{New York, NY, USA}},
  doi = {10.1145/3290605.3300361}
}
```

Now point to this as your bibliography in your R Markdown file, cite it, and add a 'References' heading by the end of the document:

```` markdown
---
title: "R Markdown + LaTeX Templates = <3"
silly-abstract: "This is the greatest and best abstract in the world."
silly-author-summary: "The important thing to know about this paper is that it is was written in close collaboration with Tenacious D, without whom our academic universe would have seized to be."
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
bibliography: references.bib
---

# Hello, LaTeX template!

This is a test.
This is a citation: @lyngs2019

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

# References
````

When you knit, you get the expected output:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(str_c(image_path, "citations-csl.png"))
```

If you inspect the generated **.tex** file when we build to PDF (you can save this by adding `keep_tex: true` under the `bookdown::pdf_document2` options), you can see that the citation text itself is included as plain text in the body:

``` latex
This is a citation: Lyngs et al. (2019)
```

And the references section is generated with embedding the citation in a `CSLReferences` environment:

``` latex
\begin{CSLReferences}{1}{0}
\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{ref-lyngs2019}{}}%
Lyngs, Ulrik, Kai Lukoff, Petr Slovak, Reuben Binns, Adam Slack, Michael Inzlicht, Max Van Kleek, and Nigel Shadbolt. 2019. {``Self-{Control} in {Cyberspace}: Applying {Dual Systems Theory} to a {Review} of {Digital Self}-{Control Tools}.''} In \emph{{CHIConference} on {Human Factors} in {Computing Systems Proceedings} ({CHI} 2019)}. {New York, NY, USA}: {ACM}. \url{https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300361}.

\end{CSLReferences}
```

## Natbib

To use the [`natbib` package](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib) for referencing, first add `citation_package: natbib` **in the YAML header of your R Markdown file:**

``` markdown
...
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
    citation_package: natbib
bibliography: references.bib
```

Then, **in the LaTeX template**, first (1) add `\usepackage[options]{natbib}`, and set a [citation style](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Natbib_bibliography_styles) with `\bibliographystyle{stylename}`, somewhere before `\begin{document}`.
Then, (2) point to your bibliography with `\bibliography{your-reference-file}` before `\end{document}`.

In our example, the PLOS template came with a style sheet in their **plos2015.bst** file, so we'll use that.

``` latex
\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{plos2015.bst}

...

\bibliography{$bibliography$}
\end{document}
```

The PLOS template also includes the `cite` package. Comment this out, because we're now using `natbib` instead.
``` latex
% cite package, to clean up citations in the main text. Do not remove.
% \usepackage{cite}

```

When you knit, you get this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(str_c(image_path, "citations-natbib.png"))
```

If you inspect the **.tex** file generating the PDF, you can see that the citation is generated with the `\citep` command, and that the bibliography is simply generated from a `\bibliography` call.

``` latex
This is a citation: \citep{lyngs2019}

...

\bibliography{references.bib}
```

## Biblatex

To use [`biblatex`](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_biblatex) for citations, first add `citation_package: biblatex` in the YAML header of your R Markdown file:

``` latex
...
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
    citation_package: biblatex
bibliography: references.bib
```

Then, **in the LaTeX template**, you first (1) add `\usepackage{biblatex}` and point to your bibliography with `\addbibresource{your-references-file}`, somewhere before `\begin{document}`.
Second, (2) add the command `\printbibliography` where you want the references section to be printed.

``` latex
\usepackage{biblatex}
\addbibresource{$bibliography$}

...

\printbibliography
\end{document}
```

In the specific case of the PLOS template, it turns out we also need to change `\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}` to `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`, for reasons explained on [StackOverflow](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/49610/use-biblatex-and-utf8).

When you knit, you get this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(str_c(image_path, "citations-biblatex.png"))
```


If you inspect the **.tex** file generating the PDF, you can see that our citation is inserted with the `\autocite` command, whereas the bibliography is simply generated with the `\printbibliography` call.

``` latex
This is a citation: \autocite{lyngs2019}

...

\printbibliography
```

That's it!
Go and change the LaTeX world with R Markdown!
