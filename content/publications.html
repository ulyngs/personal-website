Third-party tracking, the collection and sharing of behavioural data about individuals, is a significant and ubiquitous privacy threat in mobile apps. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced in 2018 to protect personal data better, but there exists, thus far, limited empirical evidence about its efficacy. This paper studies tracking in nearly two million Android apps from before and after the introduction of the GDPR. Our analysis suggests that there has been limited change in the presence of third-party tracking in apps, and that the concentration of tracking capabilities among a few large gatekeeper companies persists. However, change might be imminent.

<p>Online settings have been suggested as viable sites for youth to develop social, emotional, and technical skills that can positively shape their behavior online. However, little work has been done to understand how online governance structures might support (or hinder) such learning.</p>
<p>Using mixed-methods research, we report findings from a 2-year, in-the-wild study of 8–13 year olds on a custom multiplayer Minecraft server. 24 The two-part study focuses on the design of youth-centered models of community governance drawn from evidence-based offline practices in the prevention and learning sciences.</p>
Preliminary results point to a set of socio-technical design approaches shaping player behavior while also supporting youth interest in Minecraft-like online environments. More broadly, the findings suggest an alternative vision of youth’s capacity for ownership and control of mechanisms shaping the culture and climate of their online communities: managing player behavior while challenging current norms around adult control and surveillance of youth activity.

<p>In the attention economy, video apps employ design mechanisms like autoplay that exploit psychological vulnerabilities to maximize watch time.
Consequently, many people feel a lack of agency over their app use, which is linked to negative life effects such as loss of sleep.</p>
<p>Prior design research has innovated external mechanisms that police multiple apps, such as lockout timers.
In this work, we shift the focus to how the internal mechanisms of an app can support user agency, taking the popular YouTube mobile app as a test case.</p>
From a survey of 120 U.S. users, we find that autoplay and recommendations primarily undermine sense of agency, while search and playlists support it.
From 13 co-design sessions, we find that when users have a specific intention for how they want to use YouTube they prefer interfaces that support greater agency.
We discuss implications for how designers can help users reclaim a sense of agency over their media use.

<p>Instant access to information, entertainment, and connection enabled by smartphones and computers provides innumerable benefits, but also unprecedented opportunity for distraction.
However, while technology companies have devoted enormous resources to keeping users ‘hooked’ on digital systems, little is known about how designers can best support people in regaining control over their digital device use.</p>
<p>This thesis argues that the emerging research into design patterns for digital self-control, which attempts to address this challenge, will benefit from (i) drawing on established psychological research on self-control, and (ii) using the existing landscape of apps and browser extensions for digital self-control on online stores as a resource for understanding potential design patterns and implementations.</p>
<p>To substantiate these arguments, the thesis proceeds in four steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we adapt a well-established dual systems framework to the context of digital device use, to help explain the psychological mechanisms that underlie self-control struggles.</li>
<li>Second, we investigate digital self-control tools (n = 367) on the Chrome Web, Google Play, and Apple App stores, by analysing their design features, user numbers, ratings, and reviews.</li>
<li>Third, we present a controlled study of interventions for Facebook, drawn from popular tools on the Chrome Web store.</li>
<li>Fourth, distilling findings from the previous steps, we present a workshop format intended as a research tool for long-term investigation of user struggles and solution strategies, to better understand and respond to the pervasive challenge of digital self-control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the thesis, we adopt open science practices and make our materials, data, and analyses publicly available.</p>
The thesis concludes by arguing that future research should focus on design patterns that enable users to sculpt their digital environments such that the amount of — and motivational pull from — the information they are exposed to remain within a range that allows them to exert effective self-control without being overwhelmed by distractions.

<p>Robot accidents are inevitable. Although rare, they have been happening since assembly line robots were first introduced in the 1960s. But a new generation of social robots is now becoming commonplace. Equipped with sophisticated embedded artificial intelligence (AI), social robots might be deployed as care robots to assist elderly or disabled people to live independently. Smart robot toys offer a compelling interactive play experience for children, and increasingly capable autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer the promise of hands-free personal transport and fully autonomous taxis. Unlike industrial robots, which are deployed in safety cages, social robots are designed to operate in human environments and interact closely with humans; the likelihood of robot accidents is therefore much greater for social robots than industrial robots.</p>
This chapter sets out a draft framework for social robot accident investigation, a framework that proposes both the technology and processes that would allow social robot accidents to be investigated with no less rigour than we expect of air or rail accident investigations. The chapter also places accident investigation within the practice of responsible robotics and makes the case that social robotics without accident investigation would be no less irresponsible than aviation without air accident investigation.

<p>Hundreds of popular mobile apps today market their ties to mindfulness. What activities do these apps support and what benefits do they claim? How do mindfulness teachers, as domain experts, view these apps?</p>
<p>We first conduct an exploratory review of 370 mindfulness-related apps on Google Play, finding that mindfulness is presented primarily as a tool for relaxation and stress reduction.
We then interviewed 15 U.S. mindfulness teachers from the therapeutic, Buddhist, and Yogic traditions about their perspectives on these apps.
Teachers expressed concern that apps that introduce mindfulness only as a tool for relaxation neglect its full potential.</p>
We draw upon the experiences of these teachers to suggest design implications for linking mindfulness with further contemplative practices like the cultivation of compassion.
Our results also speak to the importance of coherence in design: that the metaphors and mechanisms of a technology align with the underlying principles it follows.

<p>Beyond being the world’s largest social network, Facebook is for many also one of its greatest sources of digital distraction.
For students, problematic use has been associated with negative effects on academic achievement and general wellbeing.</p>
<p>To understand what strategies could help users regain control, we investigated how simple interventions to the Facebook UI affect behaviour and perceived control.
We assigned 58 university students to one of three interventions: goal reminders, removed newsfeed, or white background (control).
We logged use for 6 weeks, applied interventions in the middle weeks, and administered fortnightly surveys.</p>
<p>Both goal reminders and removed newsfeed helped participants stay on task and avoid distraction.
However, goal reminders were often annoying, and removing the newsfeed made some fear missing out on information.</p>
Our findings point to future interventions such as controls for adjusting types and amount of available information, and flexible blocking which matches individual definitions of ‘distraction’.

<p>Self-control struggles are a key factor in many negative effects of digital device use on well-being, such as problematic use of social media.
Students, in particular, often struggle to get the benefits of digital connectivity without comprising their ability to be immersed in academic work or facing negative effects on their well-being.</p>
<p>We present an early glimpse at a collaboration with the Counselling Service at the University of Oxford around the ’Reducing Digital Distraction’ (ReDD) workshop, which attempts to tackle this challenge.
In these workshops, students reflect on their struggles and goals around digital device use, which they match with concrete tools and strategies.</p>
Preliminary results suggest the workshops help users, while generating high quality data for understanding the problem.

<p>Device use in smart homes is becoming increasingly communal, requiring cohabitants to navigate a complex social and technological context. In this paper, we report findings from an exploratory survey grounded in our prior work on communal technology use in the home.</p>
The findings highlight the importance of considering qualities of social relationships and technology in understanding expectations and intentions of communal technology use.
We propose a design perspective of social expectations, and we suggest existing designs can be expanded using already available information such as location, and considering additional information, such as levels of trust and reliability.

<p>Many people struggle to control their use of digital devices. However, our understanding of the design mechanisms that support user self-control remains limited.</p>
<p>In this paper, we make two contributions to HCI research in this space: first, we analyse 367 apps and browser extensions from the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores to identify common core design features and intervention strategies afforded by current tools for digital self-control.</p>
<p>Second, we adapt and apply an integrative dual systems model of self-regulation as a framework for organising and evaluating the design features found.</p>
Our analysis aims to help the design of better tools in two ways:
(i) by identifying how, through a well-established model of self-regulation, current tools overlap and differ in how they support self-control;
and (ii) by using the model to reveal underexplored cognitive mechanisms that could aid the design of new tools.

<p>Third party tracking allows companies to identify users and track their behaviour across multiple digital services.
This paper presents an empirical study of the prevalence of third-party trackers on 959,000 apps from the US and UK Google Play stores.</p>
<p>We find that most apps contain third party tracking, and the distribution of trackers is long-tailed with several highly dominant trackers accounting for a large portion of the coverage.</p>
<p>The extent of tracking also differs between categories of apps; in particular, news apps and apps targeted at children appear to be amongst the worst in terms of the number of third party trackers associated with them.</p>
<p>Third party tracking is also revealed to be a highly trans-national phenomenon, with many trackers operating in jurisdictions outside the EU.</p>
Based on these findings, we draw out some significant legal compliance challenges facing the tracking industry.

<p>Equating users’ true needs and desires with behavioural measures of ‘engagement’ is problematic.
However, good metrics of ‘true preferences’ are difficult to define, as cognitive biases make people’s preferences change with context and exhibit inconsistencies over time.</p>
<p>Yet, HCI research often glosses over the philosophical and theoretical depth of what it means to infer what users really want.</p>
In this paper, we present an alternative yet very real discussion of this issue, via a fictive dialogue between senior executives in a tech company aimed at helping people live the life they ‘really’ want to live.
How will the designers settle on a metric for their product to optimise?

<p>A majority of users of smartphones and laptops report that they struggle with effective self-control over their device use.
In response, HCI research — as well as a rapidly growing commercial market for ‘anti-distraction tools’ — has begun to develop apps, browser plugins, and other tools that help users understand and regulate their use.</p>
<p>The extensive literature on the mechanics of self-regulation from cognitive neuroscience and behavioural economics might help guide this work.
However, so far the emerging HCI work has drawn on a very limited subset of self-regulatory models, in particular Social-Cognitive Theory.</p>
Here, we draw together main insights from a broader spectrum of basic research on the mechanics of self-regulation in a simple framework.
We use the generated model to analyse interventions in a sample of 112 existing anti-distraction tools, and hope it may contribute a useful alternative view of the design space for UI features that support self-regulation.

<p>Data-driven decision-making consequential to individuals raises important questions of accountability and justice.
Indeed, European law provides individuals limited rights to ‘meaningful information about the logic’ behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and CV filtering.</p>
<p>We undertake three experimental studies examining people’s perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles.</p>
<p>Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions.
Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity.</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles—under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects.</p>
Our results suggests there may be no ‘best’ approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.

<p>In this report, we present findings from our online survey of 220 parents with children aged 6-10, mainly from the U.K. and other western countries, regarding their privacy concerns and expectations of their children’s use of mobile apps.</p>
<p>Three key findings:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Parents are generally concerned about their children’s online privacy. However, when choosing mobile apps for their children, parents primarily focus on the content of the apps and what the apps do, instead of the personal information that might be collected by the apps.</p></li>
<li><p>Most parents use a range of technical restrictions to safeguard their children. However, apps used by the children, as reported by the participant families, are not always appropriate for their age even though parents seem to be vigilant.</p></li>
<li><p>Although parents are fairly happy with their children’s awareness of privacy risks, and a good proportion of them also regularly discuss privacy issues with their children, parents struggle with persuading their children to choose alternative apps when risks arise.</p>

<p>Previous research has found that the perceived brightness of a face can be distorted by the social category of race.
Thus, Levin and Banaji (2006) found, in a U.S. sample, that faces of identical brightness were perceived to be lighter if they had stereotypical White American features than if they had Black American features.</p>
<p>Here, we present 2 experiments conducted in Natal, Brazil, that extend this line of research.
Experiment 1 tested if the brightness distortion effect would generalize to a Brazilian population.
Experiment 2 tested if speech accent would have a similar effect on brightness perception.</p>
<p>In Experiment 1, we found that the brightness distortion effect clearly replicated in the Brazilian sample:
Faces with Black racial features were perceived to be darker than faces with White racial features, even though their objective brightness was identical.</p>
<p>In Experiment 2, we found that speech accent influenced brightness perception in a similar manner:
Faces were perceived to be darker when paired with an accent associated with low socioeconomic status than when they were paired with an accent associated with high socioeconomic status.</p>
Whereas racial concepts in Brazil are often claimed to be much more fluid compared with the United States, our findings suggest that the populations are quite similar with respect to associations between facial features and skin tone.
Our findings also demonstrate speech accent as an additional source of category information that perceptual cognition can take into account when modeling the world.

<p>Many theories of religion assume that religion is a cultural system that adjusts the behaviour of its adherents towards behaviour that benefits the group.
An important proximate perspective on this is the workings of individuals’ self-control, that is, of how people suppress conflicting impulses in the service of long-term goals and social standards. Researchers have recently started to explore religion explicitly through this lens, and have suggested that religion is a cultural tool that systematically improves the self-control of its adherents.</p>
<p>In this thesis, I review correlational and experimental evidence on the effects of religion on self-control measures, along with current psychological theories of self-control.
Despite heterogeneity in the concept of ‘religion’, the available evidence gives modest support to a general relationship between religion and self-control:
Survey evidence across religions finds that religiosity predicts adherence to group-goals that require self-restraint, correlational studies show positive associations between religiosity and measures of self-control ability, and experimental evidence finds religious priming to improve performance on self-control tasks in the lab.</p>
Some researchers have interpreted these findings using the ‘strength’ model of self-control, but current discussions in cognitive psychology suggest that purely motivational accounts give a more plausible picture of the workings of self-control.
I integrate three motivational models and show how they account for current findings on religion and self-control.
These integrated models provide an explanatory framework for how differences in beliefs and values make individuals perceive the costs and benefits of religious commitment differently, leading to differences in self-control.
