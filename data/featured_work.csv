TRUE,"Ulysses in Cyberspace: Examining the Effectiveness of
Design Patterns for Digital Self-Control",How can we design digital devices that make it easier for people to stay in control of their use? My DPhil thesis attempts to answer this question by combining established psychological research on self-control with mixed-methods studies of the landscape of apps and browser extensions for digital self-control on online stores.,DPhil thesis: [HTML](https://ulyngs.github.io/phd-thesis/) | [PDF](https://ulyngs.github.io/phd-thesis/_main.pdf),https://youtu.be/GCOnzStHQcM,https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCOnzStHQcM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
TRUE,‘I Just Want to Hack Myself to Not Get Distracted’: Evaluating Design Interventions for Self-Control on Facebook,"Many people use browser extensions such as 'Newsfeed Eradicator' to make Facebook less distracting. We studied how removing the newsfeed or adding goal reminders on Facebook affect behaviour and perceived control. Both interventions helped people stay on task and avoid distraction, with large --- and distinct --- effects on behaviour.",[CHI'20 Paper](/publications/#evaluating_design_interventions_for_self_control_on_facebook),https://youtu.be/zj9I-2gjths,https://www.youtube.com/embed/zj9I-2gjths,https://youtu.be/bsBpGkPV83w,https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsBpGkPV83w,NA,NA,NA

TRUE,Self-Control in Cyberspace: Applying Dual Systems Theory to a Review of Digital Self-Control Tools,"Hundreds of apps and browser extensions promise to help people exercise self-control over digital device use by, e.g., removing distractions or limiting time spent. 
We reviewed design features in 367 such tools from the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores and analysed them using a dual systems model of self-regulation.",[CHI'19 Paper](/publications/#applying_dual_systems_theory_to_digital_self_control_tools) <img src='/images/ribbon_xs.png' style='height: 1em;'> *Honourable Mention* award,https://youtu.be/kf-TwEo954s,https://www.youtube.com/embed/kf-TwEo954s,https://youtu.be/sJf_F7faczU,https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJf_F7faczU,NA,NA,NA
