TRUE,"Ulysses in Cyberspace: Examining the Effectiveness of
Design Patterns for Digital Self-Control",How can we design digital devices that make it easier for people to stay in control of their use? My DPhil thesis attempts to answer this question by combining established psychological research on self-control with mixed-methods studies of the landscape of apps and browser extensions for digital self-control on online stores.,DPhil thesis: [HTML](https://ulyngs.github.io/phd-thesis/) | [PDF](https://ulyngs.github.io/phd-thesis/_main.pdf),https://youtu.be/GCOnzStHQcM,https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCOnzStHQcM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

TRUE,Self-Control in Cyberspace: Applying Dual Systems Theory to a Review of Digital Self-Control Tools,"Hundreds of apps and browser extensions promise to help people exercise self-control over digital device use by, e.g., removing distractions or limiting time spent. 
We reviewed design features in 367 such tools from the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores and analysed them using a dual systems model of self-regulation.",[CHI'19 Paper](/publications/#applying_dual_systems_theory_to_digital_self_control_tools) <img src='/images/ribbon_xs.png' style='height: 1em;'> *Honourable Mention* award,https://youtu.be/kf-TwEo954s,https://www.youtube.com/embed/kf-TwEo954s,https://youtu.be/sJf_F7faczU,https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJf_F7faczU,NA,NA,NA
