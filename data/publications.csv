The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced in 2018 to protect personal data better, but there exists, thus far, limited empirical evidence about its efficacy. This paper studies tracking in nearly two million Android apps from before and after the introduction of the GDPR. Our analysis suggests that there has been limited change in the presence of third-party tracking in apps, and that the concentration of tracking capabilities among a few large gatekeeper companies persists.

However, little work has been done to understand how online governance structures might support (or hinder) such learning. 

Using mixed-methods research, we report findings from a 2-year, in-the-wild study of 8–13 year olds on a custom multiplayer Minecraft server. 24 The two-part study focuses on the design of youth-centered models of community governance drawn from evidence-based offline practices in the prevention and learning sciences. 

Preliminary results point to a set of socio-technical design approaches shaping player behavior while also supporting youth interest in Minecraft-like online environments. More broadly, the findings suggest an alternative vision of youth’s capacity for ownership and control of mechanisms shaping the culture and climate of their online communities: managing player behavior while challenging current norms around adult control and surveillance of youth activity.","Many people feel a lack of agency over their app use, which is linked to negative life effects such as loss of sleep.

However, while technology companies have devoted enormous resources to keeping users ‘hooked’ on digital systems, little is known about how designers can best support people in regaining control over their digital device use. 

This thesis argues that the emerging research into design patterns for digital self-control, which attempts to address this challenge, will benefit from (i) drawing on established psychological research on self-control, and (ii) using the existing landscape of apps and browser extensions for digital self-control on online stores as a resource for understanding potential design patterns and implementations.

To substantiate these arguments, the thesis proceeds in four steps: 

- First, we adapt a well-established dual systems framework to the context of digital device use, to help explain the psychological mechanisms that underlie self-control struggles. 
- Second, we investigate digital self-control tools (n = 367) on the Chrome Web, Google Play, and Apple App stores, by analysing their design features, user numbers, ratings, and reviews. 
- Third, we present a controlled study of interventions for Facebook, drawn from popular tools on the Chrome Web store. 
- Fourth, distilling findings from the previous steps, we present a workshop format intended as a research tool for long-term investigation of user struggles and solution strategies, to better understand and respond to the pervasive challenge of digital self-control.

Consequently, many people feel a lack of agency over their app use, which is linked to negative life effects such as loss of sleep. 

Prior design research has innovated external mechanisms that police multiple apps, such as lockout timers. 
In this work, we shift the focus to how the internal mechanisms of an app can support user agency, taking the popular YouTube mobile app as a test case. 

From a survey of 120 U.S. users, we find that autoplay and recommendations primarily undermine sense of agency, while search and playlists support it.

For students, problematic use has been associated with negative effects on academic achievement and general wellbeing. 

To understand what strategies could help users regain control, we investigated how simple interventions to the Facebook UI affect behaviour and perceived control. 
We assigned 58 university students to one of three interventions: goal reminders, removed newsfeed, or white background (control). 
We logged use for 6 weeks, applied interventions in the middle weeks, and administered fortnightly surveys. 

Both goal reminders and removed newsfeed helped participants stay on task and avoid distraction. 
However, goal reminders were often annoying, and removing the newsfeed made some fear missing out on information.

Although rare, they have been happening since assembly line robots were first introduced in the 1960s. But a new generation of social robots is now becoming commonplace. Equipped with sophisticated embedded artificial intelligence (AI), social robots might be deployed as care robots to assist elderly or disabled people to live independently. Smart robot toys offer a compelling interactive play experience for children, and increasingly capable autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer the promise of hands-free personal transport and fully autonomous taxis. Unlike industrial robots, which are deployed in safety cages, social robots are designed to operate in human environments and interact closely with humans; the likelihood of robot accidents is therefore much greater for social robots than industrial robots. 

This chapter sets out a draft framework for social robot accident investigation, a framework that proposes both the technology and processes that would allow social robot accidents to be investigated with no less rigour than we expect of air or rail accident investigations. The chapter also places accident investigation within the practice of responsible robotics and makes the case that social robotics without accident investigation would be no less irresponsible than aviation without air accident investigation.",NA,"[Software Engineering for Robotics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-66494-7), Cavalcanti et al.

However, our understanding of the design mechanisms that support user self-control remains limited.

Second, we adapt and apply an integrative dual systems model of self-regulation as a framework for organising and evaluating the design features found. 

Our analysis aims to help the design of better tools in two ways:
(i) by identifying how, through a well-established model of self-regulation, current tools overlap and differ in how they support self-control; 
and (ii) by using the model to reveal underexplored cognitive mechanisms that could aid the design of new tools.",NA,ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,CHI'19,Applying Dual Systems Theory to Digital Self-Control Tools,Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Best paper honourable mention (top 5%),https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300361,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00157.pdf,https://osf.io/zyj4h/,https://ulyngs.github.io/cog-design-space-ict-self-control/,https://ulriklyngs.com/post/2019/04/30/367-tools-of-resistance-in-the-battle-for-online-attention/,https://youtu.be/sJf_F7faczU,https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJf_F7faczU,https://youtu.be/kf-TwEo954s,https://www.youtube.com/embed/kf-TwEo954s,NA,y,y,y,feature_plot.png,digital-self-control,y,Paper (archival),Honourable Mention

Indeed, European law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and CV filtering. 

We undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. 

Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. 
Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. 

Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects.

2. Most parents use a range of technical restrictions to safeguard their children. However, apps used by the children, as reported by the participant families, are not always appropriate for their age even though parents seem to be vigilant.

Moreover, contrary to our expectations, we found that participants who used their phones more, and who were more attached to them, found the tasks more fun/exciting and effortless, if they completed them with their phone present.",NA,39th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society,CogSci'17,NA,Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society,NA,https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2017/papers/0501/index.html,/pdfs/2017_lyngs_mckay_cell_perf_cogsci.pdf,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,y,y,NA,NA,digital-self-control,NA,Extended abstract,NA

NA,journal article,"Ulrik Lyngs, Emma Cohen, Wall Hattori, Martha Newson, Dan Levin",2016-12-01,Hearing in Colour: How Expectations Distort Perception of Skin Tone,"Previous research has found that the perceived brightness of a face can be distorted by the social category of race. 
Thus, Levin and Banaji (2006) found, in a U.S. sample, that faces of identical brightness were perceived to be lighter if they had stereotypical White American features than if they had Black American features. 

Here, we present 2 experiments conducted in Natal, Brazil, that extend this line of research. 
Experiment 1 tested if the brightness distortion effect would generalize to a Brazilian population. 
Experiment 2 tested if speech accent would have a similar effect on brightness perception. 

In Experiment 1, we found that the brightness distortion effect clearly replicated in the Brazilian sample: 
Faces with Black racial features were perceived to be darker than faces with White racial features, even though their objective brightness was identical. 

In Experiment 2, we found that speech accent influenced brightness perception in a similar manner: 
Faces were perceived to be darker when paired with an accent associated with low socioeconomic status than when they were paired with an accent associated with high socioeconomic status. 

Whereas racial concepts in Brazil are often claimed to be much more fluid compared with the United States, our findings suggest that the populations are quite similar with respect to associations between facial features and skin tone. 
Our findings also demonstrate speech accent as an additional source of category information that perceptual cognition can take into account when modeling the world.",NA,"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 42(12), 2068-2076",JEP:HPP,NA,"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 42 (12), 2068-2076",NA,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-49029-001,/pdfs/2016_lyngs_hearing_color.pdf,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,y,NA,NA,NA,hearing-colour,NA,NA,NA
NA,thesis,Ulrik Lyngs,2016-02-01,"What I Hate, That Do I: Religion as a Cultural Tool for Cognitive Control","Many theories of religion assume that religion is a cultural system that adjusts the behaviour of its adherents towards behaviour that benefits the group. 
An important proximate perspective on this is the workings of individuals’ self-control, that is, of how people suppress conflicting impulses in the service of long-term goals and social standards. Researchers have recently started to explore religion explicitly through this lens, and have suggested that religion is a cultural tool that systematically improves the self-control of its adherents. 

In this thesis, I review correlational and experimental evidence on the effects of religion on self-control measures, along with current psychological theories of self-control. 
Despite heterogeneity in the concept of ‘religion’, the available evidence gives modest support to a general relationship between religion and self-control: 
Survey evidence across religions finds that religiosity predicts adherence to group-goals that require self-restraint, correlational studies show positive associations between religiosity and measures of self-control ability, and experimental evidence finds religious priming to improve performance on self-control tasks in the lab. 

Some researchers have interpreted these findings using the ‘strength’ model of self-control, but current discussions in cognitive psychology suggest that purely motivational accounts give a more plausible picture of the workings of self-control.
I integrate three motivational models and show how they account for current findings on religion and self-control. 
These integrated models provide an explanatory framework for how differences in beliefs and values make individuals perceive the costs and benefits of religious commitment differently, leading to differences in self-control.",NA,"Dept. for The Study of Religion, Aarhus University",MA Thesis,NA,NA,NA,https://ulriklyngs.com/pdfs/2016_lyngs_ma_thesis_cultural_self_control.pdf,/pdfs/2016_lyngs_ma_thesis_cultural_self_control.pdf,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,religion-self-control,NA,NA,NA
